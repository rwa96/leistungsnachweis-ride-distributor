# Google style uses attached braces and indented class access modifiers.
# See the indent-modifiers option for an example of the indented modifiers format.
# This is not actually a unique brace style, but is Java style with a non-brace
# variation. This style frequently is used with an indent of 2 spaces.
--style=java

# --indent=spaces / --indent=spaces=# / -s#
# Indent using # spaces per indent (e.g. -s3 --indent=spaces=3). # must be
# between 2 and 20. Not specifying # will result in a default of 4 spaces per indent.
#--indent=spaces=4

# --indent-continuation=# / -xt#
# Set the continuation indent for a line that ends with an opening paren '('
# or an assignment '='. This includes function definitions and declarations.
# It will also modify the previous indent-after-paren option. The value for #
# indicates a number of indents. The valid values are the integer values
# from 0 thru 4. If this option is not used, the default value of 1 is used.
#--indent-continuation=1

# Set the minimal indent that is added when a header is built of multiple lines.
# This indent helps to easily separate the header from the command statements
# that follow. The value for # indicates a number of indents and is a minimum value.
# The indent may be greater to align with the data on the previous line.
#
# The valid values are:
# 0 - no minimal indent. The lines will be aligned with the paren on the preceding line.
# 1 - indent at least one additional indent.
# 2 - indent at least two additional indents.
# 3 - indent at least one-half an additional indent. This is intended for large indents (e.g. 8).
# The default value is 2, two additional indents.
#--min-conditional-indent=1

# Pad empty lines around header blocks (e.g. 'if', 'for', 'while'...).
#--break-blocks

# Insert space padding around operators. This will also pad commas.
# Any end of line comments will remain in the original column, if possible.
# Note that there is no option to unpad. Once padded, they stay padded.
#--pad-oper

# Insert space padding after commas. This is not needed if pad-oper is used.
# Any end of line comments will remain in the original column, if possible.
# Note that there is no option to unpad. Once padded, they stay padded.
#--pad-comma

# Remove extra space padding around parens on the inside and outside.
# Any end of line comments will remain in the original column, if possible.
# This option can be used in combination with the paren padding options pad‑paren,
# pad‑paren‑out, pad‑paren‑in, and pad‑header above.
# Only padding that has not been requested by other options will be removed.
#
# For example, if a source has parens padded on both the inside and outside,
# and you want inside only. You need to use unpad-paren to remove the outside padding,
# and pad‑paren‑in to retain the inside padding.
# Using only pad‑paren‑in> would not remove the outside padding.
#--unpad-paren

# Attach a pointer or reference operator (*, &, or ^) to either the variable type (left)
# or variable name (right), or place it between the type and name (middle).
# The spacing between the type and name will be preserved, if possible.
# This option is for C/C++, C++/CLI, and C# files. To format references separately,
# use the following align-reference option.
#--align-reference=type

# Add braces to unbraced one line conditional statements (e.g. 'if', 'for', 'while'...).
# The statement must be on a single line.
# The braces will be added according to the requested brace style.
# If no style is requested the braces will be attached.
#
# Braces will NOT be added to a multi-statement line if keep-one-line-statements is requested.
# Braces will NOT be added to a one line block if keep-one-line-blocks is requested.
# If used with --add-one-line-braces, the result will be one line braces.
#--add-braces

# Add one line braces to unbraced one line conditional statements (e.g. 'if', 'for', 'while'...).
# The statement must be on a single line. The option implies --keep-one-line-blocks and will not break the one line blocks.
#--add-one-line-braces

# The option max‑code‑length will break a line if the code exceeds # characters.
# The valid values are 50 thru 200. Lines without logical conditionals will
# break on a logical conditional (||, &&, ...), comma, paren, semicolon, or space.
#
# Some code will not be broken, such as comments, quotes, and arrays.
# If used with keep‑one‑line‑blocks or add-one-line-braces the blocks will NOT be broken.
# If used with keep‑one‑line‑statements the statements will be broken at a
# semicolon if the line goes over the maximum length.
# If there is no available break point within the max code length,
# the line will be broken at the first available break point after the max code length.
#
# By default logical conditionals will be placed first in the new line.
# The option break‑after‑logical will cause the logical conditionals to be placed
# last on the previous line. This option has no effect without max‑code‑length.
#--max-code-length=90
#--break-after-logical

# Specify a file or subdirectory #### to be excluded from processing.
--exclude=".build/"

# Force use of the specified line end style. Valid options are windows (CRLF), linux (LF), and macold (CR).
# MacOld style is the format for Mac OS 9 and earlier. MacOS and OS X uses the Linux style.
# If one of these options is not used, the line ends will be determined automatically from the input file.
#
# When redirection is used on Windows the output will always have Windows line ends.
# This option will be ignored.
--lineend=linux

# --suffix=####
# Append the suffix #### instead of '.orig' to original file name
# (e.g. --suffix=.bak. If this is to be a file extension, the dot '.' must be included.
# Otherwise the suffix will be appended to the current file extension.
--suffix=none
